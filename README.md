navigate to the ops/ directory of the project and run:

    vagrant up

When the VM has started, access the virtual machine by running:

	vagrant ssh

The source folder will be located at /var/stonecutter

## Running
Before starting the server, build the views by running:

    gulp build

To start a web server for the application in development mode, run:

    lein ring server-headless
    
NB: running the application like this will save users into an in memory cache that will be destroyed as soon as the app is shutdown.

To start a web server with users persisted to mongodb, ensure you have mongo running locally and run:

    lein run
